# PyQt5-PDF-Injector
This Python app allows users to inject malicious payloads into PDF files through a GUI. It supports three injection methods: URL, file, and JavaScript. Users select the input and output PDF files, choose a payload, and the app creates a new PDF with the payload injected. Pre-defined JavaScript payloads are also available.
